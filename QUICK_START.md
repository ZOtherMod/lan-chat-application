## ðŸ’¡ Tips

### For the Host (Person Running the Server):
- The server will display your **computer name** (like "John-PC" or "MyLaptop")  
- Share this computer name with friends who want to join
- Choose "Connect to Local Server" in the app

### For Friends Joining (Super Easy!):
- Get the host's **computer name** (not IP address!)
- Choose "Find Server by Name"
- Enter the computer name (e.g., "John-PC")
- Click "Find & Connect" - that's it!

### Alternative Methods:
- **Auto-Scan**: Choose "Browse Available Servers" â†’ "Scan for Servers"
- **Manual IP**: Choose "Manual IP Connection" if you prefer the old way

### Troubleshooting:
- Make sure everyone is on the same WiFi network
- If connection fails, try temporarily disabling firewall
- Check that the server window is still running
